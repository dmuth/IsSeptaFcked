# The Three Laws of Robotics:
#
# 1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
# 2. A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
# 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.
